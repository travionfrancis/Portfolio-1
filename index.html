    <h3>Future Goals/Deadlines</h3>
    <p>
      I am going to finish my Coding lessons, get the certificates, and land a
      Programming job. I will also learn video recording and editing by Summer 2021.
      I will learn how to drive by the end of 2020. I will move out by the age
      of 23, with addition to becoming more confident in my abilities and
      feeling/looking better. Time is on my side this time as I have very few goals so I
      will spend my time mastering them as time goes on due to COVID-19.
